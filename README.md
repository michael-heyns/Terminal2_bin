DISCLAIMER: This program is provided with good intent.  Every effort has been made to ensure this executable is free of any virusses and harmful code.  The same executable is used daily for mission critical work by a lot of people.  My personal reputation is also on the line.  However, to protect myself, you must understand that by downloading this executable, you take full and sole responsibily of what happens thereafter.
If you are unsure in any way, rather download the source code and build a new executable yourself.
